# Miami Memory Machine

The Miami Memory Machine is my thesis project to complete my M.S. in Integrated Design and Media with NYU. You can see more about it on [my portfolio page](https://varsvisualizes.myportfolio.com/miami-memory-machine)! 

The Machine is an interactive video project that runs on Arduino and Processing. Using a laptop, a microcontroller, and something hot to drink, you can navigate through memories of someone growing up in Miami. These memories take you past the skyline and the beach bustle, to spaces more mundane and nostalgic, seen on an everyday basis. 

A Circuit Playground is booted up with Arduino to detect temperature and direction. When a hot mug is placed on top of the microcontroller, the sensor starts up the Machine, prompting the participant, "What do you remember?" As the participant drinks from their mug, the Machine iterates through videos depicting familiar sights in Miami. These memories were based on interviews with individuals who spent their adolescence in the city, focusing particularly on the Latine experiences of growing up cross-culturally in an American environment with an incredibly heavy Latine influence.
